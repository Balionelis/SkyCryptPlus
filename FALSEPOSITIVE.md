## Why Does My Antivirus Flag It as Malicious?

Windows Defender (and most modern antivirus software) employs multiple layers of defense to prevent malware from executing. These include:

1. **File Signature Verification**  
   - Every time you execute a program, Windows Defender checks its hash.  
   - If enough people have run the file, Microsoft considers it safe.  

2. **Cryptographic Signatures**  
   - Executables often have a digital signature, such as:  
     ```
     Publisher: Sun Microsystems
     ```  
   - Signed binaries are considered more trustworthy.  

3. **Heuristic Analysis**  
   - Windows Defender examines program behavior to detect suspicious activity, such as:  
     - Opening a large number of files.  
     - Writing large amounts of data to the registry.  
     - Dropping multiple files onto the disk.  

### How This Affects PyInstaller Binaries  

When you create an executable using **PyInstaller**, it behaves in a way that triggers multiple security flags:

- **Unique Hash:**  
  - Each PyInstaller binary is essentially a modified dummy executable acting as a Python interpreter with embedded bytecode.  
  - This makes it unique, meaning no one has run it beforeâ€”raising suspicion.  

- **Lack of Digital Signature:**  
  - The executable is not signed, making it appear untrusted.  

- **Unusual Behavior:**  
  - Unlike typical binaries, a PyInstaller executable behaves differently, which is often associated with malware.  

- **`--onefile` Mode Warning:**  
  - If you use the `--onefile` flag, the executable will unpack the entire Python standard library from an embedded ZIP file onto the hard drive.  
  - This is an uncommon behavior for legitimate applications and is flagged as suspicious.  

### Conclusion  

Because of these factors, Windows Defender and other antivirus software may classify PyInstaller binaries as **potential malware** and prevent them from running.
