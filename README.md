## FAQ

### Is this app safe to use?

Yes. SkyCrypt+ is fully open source, and you can review all code in this repository. It only enhances the SkyCrypt website interface and doesn't collect any personal data.

### Why does my antivirus flag it as suspicious?

This is a false positive. The application uses Electron and injects scripts to modify web content, which some security software flags as suspicious behavior. See [FALSEPOSITIVE.md](https://github.com/Balionelis/SkyCryptPlus/blob/main/FALSEPOSITIVE.md) for a detailed explanation.

### Where are configuration files stored?

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\SkyCrypt+\config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/SkyCrypt+\config.json`
