## FAQ

### Is this a RAT? Will it steal my Minecraft account?
No, it's not a RAT. The project is fully open source, and you can review the code yourself. You can even paste the source code into ChatGPT and it will confirm that it is not malicious. If you're unsure about the release files, you can compile the application yourself using PyInstaller.

### Why does my antivirus flag it as malicious?
This is a false positive. The application is safe to use. For more information on this issue, please see the [false positive explanation](https://github.com/Balionelis/SkyCryptPlus/blob/main/FALSEPOSITIVE.md) file for an explanation.
